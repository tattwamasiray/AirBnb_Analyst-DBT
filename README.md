The structure of the project is designed to have a top-down approach. This project describes how DBT help in data transformation directly in Data Warehouse along with data quality testing and created dashboard by connecting to Preset with Snowflake. Along the way I used how scd(Slowly Changing Dimenssions) help to keep track up history records as well keep update records. This AirBnb project, I used all these technological concepts.
